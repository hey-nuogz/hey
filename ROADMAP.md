# ROADMAP
## I want to do
- [x] Change name to `hey` from `tell`
- [x] Upgrade `staff` `pnpm-version` to `npm-package-version`
- [ ] Simple I18N framework
- [ ] Simple README.md
- [x] Synchronize all repo to `github` from `gitee`, and public them
- [ ] Improve `staff` manage, include keyPair manage
- [ ] Improve multi-user
- [ ] use `websocket` for moniting `staff`
## Maybe?
- [ ] WEB Push API (It can't change endpoint. Not really like that)
- [ ] Android (I've been introduced to the Dart development. But there is no time now)
## Nah
- [ ] iOS (I don't have an Apple phone)
